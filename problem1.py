# We define an S-number to be a natural number, n, that is a perfect square 
# and its square root can be obtained by splitting the decimal representation of n into 2 or more numbers 
# then adding the numbers.

# For example, 81 is an S-number because  wortel 81 =8+1.
# 6724 is an S-number: wortel 6724= 6+72+4.
# 8281 is an S-number: wortel 8281=8+2+81=82+8+1.
# 9801 is an S-number: wortel 9801=98+0+1.

# Further we define T(N) to be the sum of all S numbers nâ‰¤N. You are given T(104)=41333.

# Find T(1012)
